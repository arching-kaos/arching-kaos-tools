Requirements
------------

Even though there is a brief description of them in the README file, this space
would be more convenient to mention these.

To run this repository with no errors from missing depedencies you will need at
least the following:

bash
gpg
jq
node
npm
npx
make
curl
wget
screen

Note that some of those are checked if they already exist in your system during
installation and if not found there is an attempt to install them.

IPFS command line tool is also needed but is installed as well during the
installation process.

CJDNS can be used as a peering method. ak-cjdns-scanner can be used to retrieve
them. This requires CJDNS to be running and `dumpLinks` tool to be in your PATH.
