# The concept is simple
#
# 1. For a given file we split in 1MB files inside a temporary directory
#
# 2. We then create a map file, containing the resulted files and their sha512sum
#
# 3. We move the files to our $CHKDIR named after their checksums
#
# We ultimately want to be seeding the file so
#
# 4. We append the checksum of the original file with its name into the map file
#
# 5. We rename the map file after its checksum and move it to maps directory
#
# 6. We are done!
