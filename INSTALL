Installation instructions
-------------------------

Part 0: Introduction
--------------------

There are two ways of installing arching-kaos-tools:
1) in a Linux environment,
2) in a container environment.

In the following two sections you 'll read the relevant instructions for each
case. Requirements can be found in the `REQUIRMENTS` file and it's essentially
a list of dependencies.

Part 1: Obtaining the source code
---------------------------------

1.1 Using `git`
---------------
You can clone this repository using `git`. To be more specific, you can choose
cloning from:
a) https://github.com/arching-kaos/arching-kaos-tools
b) https://git.kaotisk-hund.com/arching-kaos-tools/.git
c) http://git.z.kaotisk-hund.com/arching-kaos-tools/.git

Note:
(c) link is working only if you are connected to the public cjdns network. If
you are not, consider it!

Example:
In a bash terminal issue the following commands:
```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/arching-kaos/arching-kaos-tools
cd arching-kaos-tools
```

After that, continue to Part 2.

1.2 Downloading an archive
--------------------------
If you don't want to use `git`, you can get the latest nightly build from:
a) https://arching-kaos.net/files/arching-kaos-tools/
b) http://[fc59:6076:6299:6776:c13d:fbb2:1226:ead0]/files/arching-kaos-tools/

Note:
(b) link is working only if you are connected to the public cjdns network. If
you are not, consider it!

Example:
In a bash terminal issue the following commands:
```
cd $HOME
mkdir arching-kaos-tools
cd arching-kaos-tools
curl -s -o arching-kaos-tools-nightly-20230914.tar.gz https://arching-kaos.net/lfiles/arching-kaos-tools/arching-kaos-tools-nightly-20230914.tar.gz
tar xvf arching-kaos-tools-nightly-20230914.tar.gz

```

Part 2: Installation
--------------------

In this part, we are supposing you have the source code obtained and laying at
$HOME/arching-kaos-tools folder. We also assume that you have an open terminal
and that you are navigated inside that folder.

2.1 Linux environment
---------------------
The source code comes with an installation script called `install.sh`. It will
check and attempt to install missing software.

Do NOT run the `install.sh` script with sudo, it will call sudo on its own
whenever is needed. Be sure to be cautious to provide it with your password when
this occurs. In case you don't have sudo access, ask your administrator to
install the dependencies that are described in the `REQUIRMENTS` file.

From inside the source code's folder issue the following command:
```
./install.sh
```

The script will prompt some paragraphs introducing you in more or less what we
already mentioned above, but it may worth reading. You get also 30 seconds to
consider if you want to continue or cancel the installation. You can cancel by
hitting CTRL+C combination from your keyboard. Closing or killing the terminal
you are running the script on, MAY have the same result.

After the process is finished and it doesn't appear to have any errors occured,
you would have completed the installation successfully.

You can move to Part 3.

2.2 Container environment
-------------------------
There are several ContainerFiles on the podman folder. Supposingly, you can use
docker as well but podman is prefered as a container environment because it is
the one that was tested.

The one that is most heavily tested is the one in the root folder of the source
code which is a link to `podman/ContainerFile.fedora`.

You can issue the following command to build the container:
```
podman build -f ContainerFile -t arching-kaos-tools .
```

After the image is build you can start it with the command:
```
podman run -p 8610:8610 -p 4001:4001 -d --name aknode arching-kaos-tools:latest
```

You can now on-board on the `aknode` running container and use the tools from
there:
```
podman exec -it aknode bash
```

Congratulations! You installed arching-kaos-tools in a container environment.

Part 3: After installation
--------------------------

Practically, you got the tools installed but you can expand more the reach of
the system. You can take a look at the `README` file if you haven't already as
it covers a lot about what is and how the tools can be used.

One way to extend your reachability is to connect to the cjdns network as
described on the `NETWORKING` file. Another way is to use Stellar network as
described in the same file.

Some notes
----------
As of publishing this very document, NETWORKING file does not exist. It will
appear soon though.

Thanks for your patience.
