# This file describe the structure of the ArchingKaos messages in their basis.
#
# As previously thought, we exchange one IPFS hash through whatever means we can.
# 
# GPG is mentioned as a signing algorithm for encryption, decryption and signing.
# Let's say we have a file named as `example`
#
# We can extend this with calling the encoder and further send the transaction
#

#FINGERPRINT="CHANGE THIS TO YOUR DEFAULT FINGERPRINT"
# We acquire the GPG fingerprint by email address
# The following example finds kaos@kaos.kaos' GPG fingerprint like this
# FINGERPRINT="$(gpg2 --list-keys | grep kaos@kaos.kaos -1 | head -n1 | awk '{print $1}')"

# Below, the usage information
