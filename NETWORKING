Networking
----------

Part 0: Introduction
--------------------
There are various ways of achieving a network in arching-kaos and some of them
are documented here. The ones that are missing, either their are under testing,
considered to be covered or not yet grasped.

Part 1: Preassumptions
----------------------
This document assumes you somehow familiarized yourself with the scripts and
their usage.

Part 2: Networking via IPFS
---------------------------
We need to mention here that when you install arching-kaos-tools, IPFS is also
installed. Furthermore, a swarm key is downloaded and installed as well. This
is used to connect to aknet swarm in IPFS. Hence, you 'll need some peers to
connect to via IPFS. Ask for that in #arching-kaos over at IRC. See `SUPPORT`
file as well.

Other than that, you can make up yourself a swarm and express your creativity
there.

Part 3: Networking via Stellar Network
--------------------------------------
Stellar Network is used as a peering system. If you own an address in XLM, you
can store a named variable in your address. You 'll be required to "lock" 0.5XLM
to persist the value you want. You'll be also required to trust ARCHINGKAOS
asset if you want your content to be retrievable via https://arching-kaos.net
and contribute with your creativity there.

Part 4: Networking with CJDNS
-----------------------------
CJDNS is a decentralized mesh networking alternative to the internet. It uses
the fc00::/8 private space of IPv6 protocol. Your IPv6 derives from your public
key where its private part is used to decrypt your incoming packets.

Using CJDNS and arching-kaos-tools to netwok around is pretty easy but there are
steps to make it work as well. Of course, you will need CJDNS to be running in
the machine you want to network with/from.
