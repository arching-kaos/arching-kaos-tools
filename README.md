Arching Kaos Tools
==================

Description
-----------

This is an installable repo which provides various tools for running Arching Kaos and use it.

Requirements
------------
Some Linx machine which has installed bash v5.1.8 or compatible or zsh v5.8 or compatible.

If this gets any updates like newer version of bash/zsh or the repo it self, it would be
nice to know which the new versions are.

If bash or zsh get that much updated that they can't take it no more... If you can, fix it!

[ ] - Install on bash (the same but to .bashrc file
[ ] - Make a useful tool of this
