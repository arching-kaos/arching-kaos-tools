Networking
----------

Part 0: Introduction
--------------------
There are various ways of achieving a network in arching-kaos and some of them
are documented here. The ones that are missing, either their are under testing,
considered to be covered or not yet grasped.

Part 1: Preassumptions
----------------------
This document assumes you somehow familiarized yourself with the scripts and
their usage.

Part 2: Networking via IPFS
---------------------------
We need to mention here that when you install arching-kaos-tools, IPFS is also
installed. Furthermore, a swarm key is downloaded and installed as well. This
is used to connect to aknet swarm in IPFS. Hence, you 'll need some peers to
connect to via IPFS. Ask for that in #arching-kaos over at IRC. See `SUPPORT`
file as well.

Other than that, you can make up yourself a swarm and express your creativity
there.

Part 3: Networking via Stellar Network
--------------------------------------
Stellar Network is used as a peering system. If you own an address in XLM, you
can store a named variable in your address. You 'll be required to "lock" 0.5XLM
to persist the value you want. You'll be also required to trust ARCHINGKAOS
asset if you want your content to be retrievable via https://arching-kaos.net
and contribute with your creativity there.

3.1 Assumption
--------------
We assume you already have a Stellar wallet and you also have direct access to
your private key. This will be needed in case you don't use some wallet,
compatible with https://laboratory.stellar.org/ which we will be using for
connecting our arching-kaos configuration link (aka AKID) with our Stellar
address.

3.2 Preparation
---------------
Before we publish anything, we need to know what we need to publish and where.

Issuing the command
```
ak config --get-ipns-key
```
will return to us the IPNS key that points to our current AKID.

We will need this value for the next step

3.3 Publishing IPNS key to Stellar network
------------------------------------------
1. Visit https://laboratory.stellar.org/#?network=public and go to the "Build
transaction" option,
2. Enter your Stellar address in the Source Address field,
3. Click the "Fetch next sequence number for account starting with ..." button,
4. Scroll down to find the "Operation Type" and select from the dropdown menu
the "Manage data" option,
5. Use as "Entry name": "config" (without the double quotes),
6. Paste the IPNS link we got from the previous section, in the "Entry value"
field,
7. Scroll further down and click the "Sign in Transaction Signer" button,
8. Sign the transaction with your wallet or your private key,
9. Submit the transaction to the Stellar Network!

Congratulations! You successfully published your IPNS reference to your AKID in
the Stellar Network.

3.4 Open a trustline to ARCHINGKAOS
-----------------------------------
To be able to post content on arching-kaos.net you will need to trust the asset
ARCHINGKAOS issued by GB4QVKD6NW3CSNO5TNPARAWNPPXOPSSTKB35XCWB7PUNBIQTK3DVELB2.

Build a transaction as described above, but instead of "Manage data" select
"ChangeTrust" option. Set the information above in the appropriate fields,
sign the transaction and submit it.

Now, your contributions will appear at https://arching-kaos.net 

Part 4: Networking with CJDNS
-----------------------------
CJDNS is a decentralized mesh networking alternative to the internet. It uses
the fc00::/8 private space of IPv6 protocol. Your IPv6 derives from your public
key where its private part is used to decrypt your incoming packets.

Using CJDNS and arching-kaos-tools to netwok around is pretty easy but there are
steps to make it work as well. Of course, you will need CJDNS to be running in
the machine you want to network with/from. Furthermore, you will also need the
cjdns-tools, laying under the tools folder in the cjdns repository to be in your
PATH.

You then can use the `ak network -s cjdns` to find other akdaemon(s) running in
your relative neighbourhood. `dumpLinks` is used to retrieve the nodes in this
area. You can find more intense scanning scripts around like `walk.sh` by ircerr
which is able to reach the whole public network of cjdns.

- http://hia.cjdns.ca/watchlist/c/walk2.sh (threaded)

> TODO: We should be storing the output on a relevant file so it can be reached by
> the API as well or ask for current known nodes without rescanning the network.

Part 5: Update on networking
----------------------------
Great news everyone! `ak-network` is here:
```
$ ak network
# ak-network - AK Nettool
# =======================
#
# Network tools
#
# Usage:
#
#    -h, --help                                           Prints this help message
#    -c, --connect [ipfs|cjdns]                           Connect to network(s)
#    -p, --peers [ipfs|cjdns|stellar|yggdrasil|incoming]  Outputs peers found
#    -s, --scan [ipfs|cjdns|stellar|yggdrasil|incoming]   Scan network(s) for peers
#
# Bonus: CJDNS network scanning modes
#
#    -s, --scan cjdns [-w|--whole]        Scan using HIA's knowledge
#    -s, --scan cjdns [-d|--dump]         Scan using CJDNS' dumpLinks (default)
```

Though:
```
$ ak network --scan ipfs
20240707_065927 <ak-network> [ERROR] Not implemented: _ak_network_scan_ipfs
```

> TODO ^^ maybe
> Which I think I should not try to do since we use `ak-config` as the key on IPFS
> to publish our `node_info` at and we can not guess keys just in case we found
> one with `node_info`. A work around could be to use the `self` key and publish
> there instead of `ak-config`. Previously, since we were using for `IPFS_REPO`
> the default directory, it was thought that the `self` key could be already in
> use. Now that we do have our own dedicated path for `IPFS_REPO`, it could be
> revisited. But, as mentioned in other places, we are about to drop IPFS in the
> future. Whichever comes first?

Part 6: Yggdrasil
-----------------
In the same way we do the full scan ( -w|--whole ) for cjdns network range, we
also do the same for Yggdrasil network. The preassumption here is that yggdrasil
is already installed and peered. We get some IP lists from scans from the YIA
service running by ircerr.

Part 7: Incoming
----------------
Incoming connections' IPs to the API are stored and can be scanned for the known
API port for peering purposes.
